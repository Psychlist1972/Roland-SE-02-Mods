# Roland SE-02 Mods

The Roland SE-02 is a fantastic-sounding synthesizer that suffers from having a tiny user interface. I've found that adjusting values with the stiff-turning (but surprisingly wobbly) switches leads me to accidentally nudge tiny and very sensitive pots like the oscillator pitch. 

Also it's economically not something everyone would want to do, I've decided to give a go at creating a new front panel. Rather than do something destructive with the existing panel, and solder new pots/controls in place and use flying wires to connect to a panel, I've decided to create a new front panel from scratch.

The new front panel would be connected to the existing voice and digital board using the same mezzanine connector that Roland uses:

Additionally, I would put it into a full synthesizer body, with a MIDI keyboard controller built in. The controller, unlike the 25 key version that Roland supplies, would have pitch/mod wheels and also velocity and aftertouch (channel pressure). Many of the SE-02 sounds really light up with these features, something you might never realize if you only used the 25 key keyboard Roland sells.
