The Roland SE-02 is a fantastic-sounding synthesizer that suffers from having a tiny user interface. I've found that adjusting values with the stiff-turning (but surprisingly wobbly) switches leads me to accidentally nudge tiny and very sensitive pots like the oscillator pitch. 

Also it's economically not something everyone would want to do, I've decided to give a go at creating a new front panel. Rather than do something destructive with the existing panel, and solder new pots/controls in place and use flying wires to connect to a panel, I've decided to create a new front panel from scratch.

The new front panel would be connected to the existing voice and digital board using the same mezzanine connector that Roland uses:

* Mouser part number: [656-WR40PVF50N1](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/JAE-Electronics/WR-40P-VF50-N1/)
* JRC Part Number: WR-40P-VF50-N1

Additionally, I would put it into a full synthesizer body, with a MIDI keyboard controller built in. The controller, unlike the 25 key version that Roland supplies, would have pitch/mod wheels and also velocity and aftertouch (channel pressure). Many of the SE-02 sounds really light up with these features, something you might never realize if you only used the 25 key keyboard Roland sells.

# Panel/Synth Design

The SE-02 doesn't really sound like a Moog or a Roland, so I've decided to just run with a more classic Roland design for the synth itself.


For panel graphics, [Maverick Label](https://www.mavericklabel.com/products/graphic-overlay.html) looks to be a good company. That is the company used for the Meeblip and others. Companies like Synthgraphics, Dave Smith Instruments, Moog, and others all use 10mil lexan with 3m adhesive backing.

# Controller Keyboard

Roland A-500 Pro keyboard controller is what I've used here. It has a great classic Roland-style pitch/mod wheel, and comes apart quite easily. The pitch/mod wheel also comes out as a single assembly, which is very helpful.

The keyboard has a channel pressure/aftertouch strip, as well as velocity, and uses a standard 26 pin connector for the matrix.

It's not as nice as a Fatar, but it's available, relatively inexpensive, and easy to work with.
